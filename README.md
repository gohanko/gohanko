Hi there! I'm a systems engineering student at Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman. I write code, study, and explore stuff online. 
Straight outta the backwaters of Sarawak, Malaysia, I currently resides in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

If you're looking for a job title, that'll be "university student / former software engineer". I just put everything on here, it's not actually a resume.

## My Projects

- [asanitize](https://github.com/gohanko/asanitize) is a simple commandline tool to bulk delete messages/posts from your social media accounts.
- [automated_unitreg](https://github.com/gohanko/automated_unitreg) is an automated tool to help me automatically register for my university courses.
- [machine-setup](https://github.com/gohanko/machine-setup) is supposed to be a tool for automating desktop linux setups like how Chef is for servers! but I realised shell scripts does the same job without some complicated ["recipes"](https://github.com/gohanko/machine-setup-recipes) and custom code. Thus my [dotfiles](https://github.com/gohanko/dotfiles) repository is born!

## May I ask some questions?
Sure. You can even send me a message on Telegram.

### Hobbies?
Automating repetitive tasks, sports like hiking/badminton, listening to some beats (J-POP, Game/Anime OSTs) and consuming anime/manga/donghua/manhuas are the things I do a lot (way too much actually, especially for the last one). I also workout sometimes... well sometimes... okay maybe once in a few months whenever I feel like it.

### Games?
I play a lot less games now than I used to but my current favourites are Genshin Impact and Escape From Tarkov.

### Code?
I am a self taught developer with around 3 years of professional work experience. Currently, I'm taking the opportunity to relax and escape the stressful rat race by taking a degree in systems engineering. 

Definitely a lot more relaxing than work, you can easily get decent grades by paying attention in class and finishing your assignments on time without putting much effort in studying outside of class, which also means I have a lot of time to use on what I think is good, like family time and hobbies.

The downside however, is that I am broke and can't willy nilly spend my money on things like holidays in a faraway paradise, not that the pandemic allows it anyway. Sometimes I do miss working, school life could be too relaxing and boring.
