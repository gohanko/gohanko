Hi there! I'm a systems engineering student at Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman. I write code, study, and explore stuff online. 
Straight outta the backwaters of Sarawak, I currently resides in another backwater town called Kampar, Perak.

If you're looking for a job title, that'll be "university student / former software engineer" (i have around 3 years of frontend + backend experience). I just put everything on here, it's not actually a resume.
