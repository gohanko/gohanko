# <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="29px" height="29px"> Hi there!
I'm a systems engineering student at Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia. I write code, study, and explore stuff online. 
Straight outta the backwaters of Sarawak, I currently resides in a college town called Kampar.

If you're looking for a job title, that'll be university student / former software engineer (i have around 3 years of frontend + backend experience). I just put everything on here, it's not actually a resume.
