Hi there! I'm a systems engineering student at Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman. I write code, study, and explore stuff online. 
Straight outta the backwaters of Sarawak, Malaysia, I currently resides in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

If you're looking for a job title, that'll be "university student / former software engineer". I just put everything on here, it's not actually a resume.

## My Projects

### In progress (... yes definitely not dead)
- [asanitize](https://github.com/gohanko/asanitize) is a simple commandline tool to bulk delete messages/posts from your social media accounts.
- [manga-direct](https://github.com/gohanko/manga-direct) is a backend and frontend to access your personal manga collection through LAN. Built using Python and NodeJS.
- [automated_unitreg](https://github.com/gohanko/automated_unitreg) is a work in progress automated tool to help me automatically register for my university courses.

## May I ask some questions?
Sure. You can even send me a message, eh?

### Hobbies?
Coding, hiking, listening to some beats (japanese, lofi, 50-90s hits, classics, Genshin OSTs, random music that i think rocks), and watching anime (I've watched way too much) are things I do a lot. I also workout sometimes... sometimes... okay maybe once in a few months

### You're from Malaysia?
Why, yes! Malaysia the land of rojak and nasi lemak. I speak English, Mandarin and Malay while learning Japanese.

### Anime?
I watch way too much anime for my own good. If you're looking for recommendations, I have way too many to pick from, they're all too good. But you can find me at [here](https://anilist.co/user/TheOriginalRin/)
