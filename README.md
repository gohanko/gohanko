Hi there! I'm a systems engineering student at Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman. I write code, study, and explore stuff online. 
Straight outta the backwaters of Sarawak, Malaysia, I currently resides in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

If you're looking for a job title, that'll be "university student / former software engineer". I just put everything on here, it's not actually a resume.
